# lemonbar-conf
My personal version of lemonbar. Heavily configured for my desktop, but can probably also look good on others. Has relatively few dependencies other than those needed by lemonbar.

# Installation
Move panel and bar input to your bin and then execute panel & in a dotfile of your choice (e.g. .xinitrc)
